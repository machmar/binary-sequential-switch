# binary-sequnential-switch
Sequential switch with a binary input of the position to choose or analog voltage to change the speed of automatic switching.

I am again using the stereo jack detect method - to select betwe binary or automatic control, plug a jack into atleast one of the binary inputs.

Also if you plug a jack into the speed socket, the attenuverter pot will function as a attenuverter for the cv. If there is no jack, it will be a precise trimm for the rate pot.
